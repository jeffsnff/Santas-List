<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Santas List is a Console Application written in C# that allows a user to input names into Santas List.
This was a weekend project I wanted to do to challenege myself while following [C# Basics](https://centria.github.io/basic-csharp/tmc) and create a small project using what I have learned so far by doing simple branching and merging as well as practicing using various loops, lists, methods and objects.

### Built With

[![C#](https://custom-icon-badges.demolab.com/badge/C%23-%23239120.svg?logo=cshrp&logoColor=white)](#)
