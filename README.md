I am currently working through https://centria.github.io/basic-csharp/tmc and I thought it would be a fun project to do for December 2024 to practice what I am learning.

During this project I will be doing simple branching and merging as well as practicing using various loops, lists, methods and objects that I have been learning in the Basic C# course.

### Updates

2024-12-09 I am going to put this project to bed for right now. I wanted to get more features added, but I was not able to finish it for various reasons. That is okay though because this was just a little challenege for me to do to take a break from expercises and do a little side project. It was good practice and I enjoyed it.
